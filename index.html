            Sir Isaac Newton ( 25 December 1642 - 20 March 1726) was an english mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian and an author who was described in his time as a natural philospher. He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightment that followed. He gave multiple laws that changed the way of looking Science and Technology. He was a man of revolution. He was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. He was awarded by lifetime achievement Oscar by the Royal Society. Further, we will see the major contributions of Sir Isaac Newton in different fields to know more about him.

            <p>
                In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his book 'Modern Astronomy' in which he described his discoveries about Law of Universal Gravitation, Law of Motion, Orbits of Planet and the Mathematical proof of Keplers Laws, that why Earth moves around the Sun and what is the basis of Keplers Laws. This is book is the result of his famous incident of falling an apple on him, thereafter he discovered gravity and gave his laws.

            <p>
                No Matter, Sir Isaac Newton majorly contributed in the field of Physics. He gave his famous three laws of motion. These three laws are so popular from many centuries as they govern the whole mechanics. Apart from mechanics, he also contributed in optics where he modified many telescopes and microscopes. In the wave theory of light and travelling and calculating the speed of sound, he gave his contribution in almost every field of physics.

            <p>
                Newton's contribution in Mathematics is always appreciated. He gave the phenominal Calculus which consist of Differential Equation and Integration. He accurately calculated the value of pi using integration which was earlier calculated by bisecting circles in millions of sectors. He gave the binomial theorem which changed the game of calculating values of different either positive, negative or fractional exponenets. He wrote his book 'Principia Mathematica' which was appreciated by Royal Society of London.

            <p>
                Newton was an unusual Christian. At some point in his adult years, and certainly by 1690, Newton had dismantled the standard biblical proofs for the doctrine of the Trinity whilst keeping his beliefs to himself.It was not until after his death in 1727 that his views became public and they have attracted study and speculation ever since.Only when evidence of Newton’s involvement in university theology disputations in 1677 came to light did it become possible to find a dateable starting point for Newton’s theological activity.

            <p>
                As he has contributed in several fields of Science and Technology, he authored multiple books such as 'Optiks', 'Principia Mathematica', 'Motion of Bodies', 'The system and the world', 'Newton's philosophy of Nature' and many more. He was a great person and blessed with so much knowledge that none of other person is so great till this time. He really changed the game of Science and Technology.

                Newton owned one of Europe's largest book collections on alchemy. Unfortunately, this part of his library was dispersed at the time of his death without an adequate inventory. Alchemy had obvious relevance to his work at the mint and its associated work on metallurgy. The study of metallurgy interested him to learn more about the matters and its structures. He studied about fluids and thier working but did not contributed much in this field.
